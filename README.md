## Exercises for Section 2.3
### **Exercise 2.3.1** . Design map-reduce algorithms to take a very large file of integers and produce as output:
#### (a) The largest integer.
 **map**:     For each tuple t, emit a key/value pair (1, t).
 **Reduce**:     key 1 represent a group, with values [t1, t2, …, tn]. Apply max to the list of all value. Emit the key/value pair (1,x), where x = max([t1, t2, …, tn])
 #### (b) The average of all the integers.
 **map**:     For each tuple t, emit a key/value pair (1, t). 
 **Reduce**:    Apply Averag to the list of all value. Emit the key/value pair (1,x), where x =  Averag([t] t in  value)
#### (c) The same set of integers, but with each integer appearing only once.
 **map**:     For each tuple t, emit a key/value pair (t, t).  **Reduce**: for each t that represent a group values 1 or mor than 1 member, Emit the key/value pair (t,t).
 #### (d) The count of the number of distinct integers in the input.
 at first we apply map and reduce in (b) to have The same set of integers, but with each integer appearing only once. then **map**:For each tuple t, emit a key/value pair (a, 1) so we have key/value (a,{1,1,...,1}). **Reduce**: emit a key/value pair(a,x)
 where x= sum[1,1,1...,1].
### Exercise 2.3.2. Design map-reduce algorithms to take a very large ?le of integers and produce as output:
the mapreduce is as same as the case that matrix is square. indeed, when we divide the matrix into vertical stripes or divide it into squre matrix is not important the last vertical diden"t have the same size or some spilite isn't a squre.

### **Exercise 2.3.5**.The relational-algebra operation R(A,B) ⊲⊳ B<C S(C,D) produces all tuples (a,b,c,d) such that tuple (a,b) is in relation R, tuple (c,d) is in S, and b < c. Give a map-reduce implementation of this operation, assuming R and S are sets.
 **map**:   For a tuple (a,b) in R emit a key/value pair (b, (‘R’,a)) 
   For a tuple (c,d) in S, emit a key/value pair(c, (‘R’,d)).
 **Reduce**: for each (b, (‘R’,a)) and (c, (‘R’,d)) if key b< key c then  emit a key/value pair ((a,b),(c,d)) Otherwise, emit a key/value pair (t, NULL)
